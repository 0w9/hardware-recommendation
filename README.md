# Hardware Recommendation

There's more and more people building in hardware. For that you need lots of components, which [McMaster-Carr](https://McMaster.com) sells ~700,000 of. The aim of this project is to:

1. Scrape all (or all relevant) products from McMaster
2. Embed the scraped items into a vector database (including CAD files)
3. Write a recommendation engine to find the best items for a project build
